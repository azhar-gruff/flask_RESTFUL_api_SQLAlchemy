To make a folder a module in python 3, you must create a file within the folder named '__init__.py'
For Heroku deployment, you need to add additional files to tell Heroku how to deploy your app
    * runtime.txt -- use version of python used to create the application
    * requirements.txt -- tells python what libraries are being use
        --uwsgi: automation tool, do not install locally
    * uwsgi.ini -- config for uwsgi process
        --http-socket: heroku chooses a port at random. This tells uwsgi to use the port provided by
            heroku
        --master = true: initiates master process
        --die-on-term = true: kills the app on termination
        --module = app:app: tells uwsgi to look at the app.py module for a variable called 'app'
        --memory-report = true: Generates a report on memory usage
    * Procfile -- what dyno (server) you want to use in heroku. Script to run server and the file
        that provides the server information. In this case, we are using uwsgi and uwsgi.ini

Checking Heroku logs
    * With heroku CLI type 'heroku logs --app=app-name'
